      <h3>After five months of decline, the price of regular diesel has risen again.</h3>
      <p>
        Common diesel saw a slight increase of 0.16% in the first half of July, reaching an average price of R$ 6.16, according to the latest analysis from the Edenred Ticket Log Price Index (IPTL).
        This marks the first price hike since February and ends a series of declines driven by Petrobras' downward price adjustments throughout the first half of 2025.
        Meanwhile, S-10 diesel recorded a drop of 0.16%, with an average price of R$ 6.18.

      <h3>Soybean prices end the week up amid expectations of Chinese buying in the U.S. market.</h3>
      <p>
        The international soybean market showed signs of recovery in recent days, closing the week with gains on the Chicago Board of Trade.
        According to data released by CEEMA (Central Internacional de Análises Econômicas e de Estudos de Mercado Agropecuário), prices once again surpassed $10.00 per bushel, reaching $10.21 on Thursday (July 17).

        Despite the USDA report indicating a reduction in planted area and an increase in U.S. soybean stocks, the possibility of China resuming purchases of American soybeans boosted the market. 
        The Asian country imported 49.4 million tons in the first half of 2025, with 79% coming from Brazil, but there is still a supply gap that is expected to be filled by the United States.

        Another supporting factor was the record soybean crush in the U.S. in June and soybean oil stocks at their lowest level since 2004. On the other hand, increased U.S. tariffs on Brazilian 
        products—especially soybean oil—generated market instability and contributed to the appreciation of the dollar, which in turn improved domestic prices in Brazil.

        The outlook is that, given Chinese demand and supply limitations from Argentina and Paraguay, the United States may regain prominence in soybean exports in the second half of the year.

      <h3>Frost events contribute to pest control in grape production.</h3>
      <p>
       Winter pruning of early-cycle grapevines has begun in the administrative region of Caxias do Sul, according to information released this Thursday (July 17) in the Emater/RS-Ascar Crop Bulletin.
        At the same time, winter fertilization is also underway, following technical recommendations for proper vineyard management.

        The agency highlighted that the frosts recorded in recent weeks have helped reduce the presence of pathogenic fungi and pests, while also acting as a natural mechanism for controlling invasive plants.

        Emater/RS-Ascar also reported that, so far, the number of chilling hours with temperatures below 7.2°C has been sufficient to meet the dormancy requirements of early-cycle grapevines. However, 
        mid- and late-cycle varieties still require additional cold accumulation to complete this physiological need.

        In the Erechim region, many grape growers have carried out vineyard cleaning, and some producers have started pruning work, marking the beginning of winter field activities for the crop.
