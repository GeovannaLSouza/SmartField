      <h3>After five months of decline, the price of regular diesel has risen again.</h3>
      <p>
        Common diesel saw a slight increase of 0.16% in the first half of July, reaching an average price of R$ 6.16, according to the latest analysis from the Edenred Ticket Log Price Index (IPTL).
This marks the first price hike since February and ends a series of declines driven by Petrobras' downward price adjustments throughout the first half of 2025.
Meanwhile, S-10 diesel recorded a drop of 0.16%, with an average price of R$ 6.18.
